## <u>Description</u>
The purpose of this challenge was to recreate a given webpage using HTML and CSS. I first planed out what elements needed to be included and where they needed to be positioned by creating a wire frame  of the website in Google Slides. <br>The biggest challenge I faced was getting the website to scale to a different sized screen.

## <u>Deployed and Usage</u>
I created this website for two main viewing dimensions: <br> 
### __Desktop 1446 x 1399__ <br>

### __Mobile iPhone XR 414 x 896__ <br>

## <u>Wire Frame</u>

## <u>What I learned</u>
I integrated [Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) into my process by delivering a working webpage and maintaining high quality communication through git commit messages, inline code comments, and this readme.

## <u>Future Development</u>
Once I have created another project, add it into work section with link to deployed site.
<br>Make CSS more responsive to various screen sizes.
